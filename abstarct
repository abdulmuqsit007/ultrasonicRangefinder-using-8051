in this project, we have built an Ultrasonic Rangefinder using 8051 Microcontroller and Ultrasonic Sensor.
We have different ways to measure the distance. One way is to use Ultra Sonic Sensor or Module for distance measurement. 
This article explains you how to measure the distance using 8051 microcontroller. 
This Ultrasonic Range Finder system measures the distance up to 4 meters with an accuracy of 3 mm.
