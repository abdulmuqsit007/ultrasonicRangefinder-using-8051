Algorithm for Program
Send HIGH pulse for 10 micro seconds on TRIG pin
Initially P3.1 = 0;

P3.1 = 1;

delay_ms (10);

P3.1 = 0;

Wait until the module transmits 40 KHz pulses. When 8thpulse is transmitted echo pin becomes HIGH, TIMER0 starts counting, when input INT0 goes LOW and timer counts the time
while (INT0 == 0);

while (INT0 == 1);

TIMER0 value is equal to the time taken by the signal to go forward and comeback so we need to take only half time.
Time required = TIMER0 VALUE/2

The speed of the ultrasonic pulse is nothing but the speed of sound which is 340.29 m/s or 34029 cm/s
Distance = speed * time = 34029 * (TIMER0) / 2
At 11.0592 MHz, TIMER0 gets incremented for 1Âµs.
Range = 17015 * TIMER0 X 10-6

Target range = TIMER0/58 cm.
